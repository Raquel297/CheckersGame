# CheckersGame
I decided to take the initiative to build my own software project. My first endeavor is a game that allows you to play against an AI algorithm that will either always win or tie the game. There are more updates coming soon to this ReadMe file and I will put program files here too. The ReadMe file will contain the specifications of the program, my thought-process about why I chose certain programming concepts instead of others, and the difficulties I faced programming this game. When code files are submitted, please feel free to make suggestions (if you are an experienced programmer) for improvements of my code. The next coding file will be uploaded to this repository no later than the end of this Saturday.
